Welcome to the Fall 2022 Season of Statasaurus!

*Statasaurus* was born in Spring 2019 with the idea of lab mates sharing knowledge about data analysis using R software. By that time, we didn't even know how to create an Rproject file. Over the years, many students have shared their coding and stats knowledge (and doubts) allowing the team to exponentially grow in terms of data analytics skills. Nowadays, we are proudly using these meetings for advanced programming topics.

::: callout-note
It is assumed that members are currently managing the basics of data analysis using R.

*General Rules*

::: callout-important
The #1 and most important rule is: *you ask for a topic, you offer a topic in exchange*.

The willing to contribute is of central importance cause we all have duties to take care about. Therefore, self-volunteers are crucial and deeply appreciated.

The meetings are not lectures. The topics agenda, as well as each class are widely open to discussion.
