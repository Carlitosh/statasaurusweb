    "text": "This contains notes about the introductory meeting, intended to:\n\nReview on the use of GitHub for collaborative projects.\nExplore the new features offered by the new development of RStudio: Quarto.\n\n\n\nGitHub is an internet hosting service designed for software development and version control using Git. Basically, GitHub facilitates to work in a collaborative manner through multiple features designed to efficiently control changes made by users during a working session.\nUseful desktop applications:\n\nGitHub Desktop\nGitKraken\n\nKey glossary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\nConcept\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nversion control\nis the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code\n\n\n2\nrepository\nis a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.\n\n\n3\nbranch\nis a unique set of code changes with a unique name.\n\n\n5\nclone\nis to copy a remote repository into your local\n\n\n4\nremote/local\nthey are Git repositories hosting code at different locations. ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù means located on the internet or another network. ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù means located in your machine.\n\n\n5\norigin\nis the remote version of a given repository.\n\n\n6\nmain/master\nis the name of the default branch. In the past ‚Äúmaster‚Äù was the default. Since 2020, ‚Äúmain‚Äù is the default name of all new source code.\n\n\n7\ncommit\nis a ‚Äúrevision‚Äù or individual set of changes to a file or group of files within a branch.\n\n\n8\npull / fetch\nis the action to fetch and download content from a remote repository to update your local repository.\n\n\n9\npush\nis the action to upload content from a local repository to update its remote version (all within a given branch).\n\n\n10\npull request\nis to let the repository owner to know about changes you‚Äôve made to his code pushing to a new named branch. It allows to discuss, review, accept/reject the changes, and eventually accept and merge your branch to update the old version (normally, the ‚Äúmain‚Äù branch).\nNote: This action allows users to appear into the ‚Äúcontributors‚Äù list of a repository.\n\n\n11\nmerge\nis the action of combining two branches into one, and putting a combined ‚Äúforked history‚Äù.\n\n\n12\nrebase\nis moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.\n\n\n13\nfast-forward\nis merging when there is a direct linear path from the source branch (updating from) to the target branch (the one updating to).\n\n\n14\nstash*\nit temporarily shelves changes you‚Äôve made to your copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later. *very useful when you need to pull and update from the remote but you have been working on your local file.\n\n\n15\nrevert\nis the ‚Äúundo‚Äù action to safely undoing changes. It creates a new commit that inverses changes.\n\n\n16\nfork\nis to copy others‚Äô repository into your account. Your forked repo will act as an independent branch, so you can commit changes and put pull request from the forked repo.\n\n\n17\nIssues\nis a section of any GitHub repository that allows to track issues experienced by users. Particularly useful for packages. Issues can be quoted and linked to pull requests.\n\n\n18\nPATs\nstands for Personal Access Tokens, which are an alternative authentication method to passwords and SSH\n\n\n19\nlfs\nthe lfs stands for Large File Storage. It allows you to track heavy files that are not allowed by default.\n\n\n20\nGitHub Actions\nis the way to automate continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). Particularly, CI is a very important a software practice for package development, since it allows to detect errors on different operative systems via multiple automated tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It allows to combine R, Python, Julia, and Java (Observable JS) for the design of reports, applications, websites, blogs, scientific publications, and more...\nKey concepts to review:\n\nqmd\nrender\nyml\ncss\n\nLearn more: https://quarto.org\n\n\n\nDownload Quarto or the latest version of RStudio\n\n\n\n\nToday, we will work together on the creation of our own hex-sticker using both Quarto and GitHub.\n\n\n\nClone a repository:\n\nOpen your web-browser and go to https://github.com/adriancorrendo/Stats_Hub_2022\nFork to your own GitHub account.\nGo to your forked repo and click on the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù button and copy the https address\n\n\nOpen Rstudio and go to File > New Project‚Ä¶ > version control > Git, and paste the link.\n\nGo to the logo > code and open the hexsticker_stats_hub.qmd file.\nInstall the required packages.\nModify the logos or create an alternative using the *.qmd file.\nCreate a commit. with your changes.\nPush (send changes).\nContribute with a Pull Request.\nWait for the PR to be merged into the original repo."

    "text": "History\nStatasaurus (a.k.a. Stats-Hub) is a series of encounters designed to share, discuss, learn, and use applied stats and computer programming for agricultural research. It was born in late Fall 2018 from the idea of several lab mates (Adrian Correndo, Santiago Tamagno, Javier Fernandez, and Luiz Moro Rosso) with the support of their advisor (Dr.¬†Ciampitti) at the KSU Crops team (now CiampittiLab).\nStatasaurus was conceived with the main goal sharing knowledge about data analysis using R software. By that time, we were mostly using excel for data wrangling, GraphPad Prism for plots, barely used R script files, no Rmarkdown for reports, and no version control. We didn‚Äôt even know how to create an *.Rproj file. Rapidly, the entire team adopted the idea and the rest is known history. Over the years, many graduate students, visiting scholars, and postdocs have been sharing their coding and stats knowledge (and doubts) allowing the team to exponentially grow in terms of data analytics skills. Nowadays, we are proudly using these meetings exclusively for advanced programming topics. Welcome to the team!\nGeneral Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe #1 and most important rule is: exchange! When you ask for a topic, you also try to offer another topic in exchange.\nThe willing to contribute is of central importance cause we all have duties to take care about. Therefore, self-volunteers are crucial and deeply appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe meetings are not lectures. Nobody‚Äôs bringing the truth! We are all learning, so we foster the discussion among members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is expected that members have:\ni. the latest version of RStudio installed.\nii. an active GitHub account, and‚Ä¶\niii. training on the basics of data analysis using R."
