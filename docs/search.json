    "text": "This article is intended to provide a brief introduction to key concepts about Bayesian theory and differences with the traditional Frequentist approach:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNeither of both, Frequentist or Bayesian, are always the most suitable solution for your analysis. However‚Ä¶.üòâ\n\n\nFor this reason, today we are going to discuss and compare both approaches.\nLet‚Äôs watch some short videos about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nOpen discussion‚Ä¶.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps, the main disagreement between Frequentism and Bayesianism is about the TRUTH.\nThe Frequentism vision is heavily rooted on the actual existence of the TRUTH. Every time we estimate a model‚Äôs parameter, we expect to approximate to a true value. It is named ‚Äúfrequentism‚Äù because it is based on the frequency of repeated events.\nFor example, if we want to assess the probability of getting a #6 when rolling a dice, Frequentism says that ‚ÄúIf we roll a dice close to infinite times, the proportion of #6 out of the total number of rolls will approach 16.7% (the theoretical probability)‚Äù. Thus, Frequentism makes inference conditional to an ideal, ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù condition of repeating the same experiment infinite times. In other words, conclusions rely on events we have not observed.\nThe Bayesian approach instead, DOES NOT assume the existence of the TRUTH. In contrast, it is based on PROBABILITIES & BELIEFS.\nPROBABILITIES: For the Bayesian vision, everything is a matter of probability. Any fact or result about an ‚Äúestimate‚Äù could range from extremely unlikely to extremely likely. However, anything is considered completely true or false.\nBELIEFS: here is probably the most important point of the Bayesian vision. Bayesian models allow to introduce (and update) prior knowledge on a topic, introducing our own certainty or uncertainty about events. EVEN IF WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW ANYTHING about it (spoiler alter: uninformative prior!).\nBayesianism considers probability as an expression of the degree of certainty (or uncertainty).\nFollowing the same example with the dice roll, Bayesian interpretation says that ‚Äúwe are, a priori, 16.7% certain we are going to get a #6‚Äù. The, Bayesianism makes inference conditional to the data we observed. We basically test the likelihood of a prior hypothesis being true given the observed data, and we generate a new ‚Äúlikelihood‚Äù of updated hypothesis being true given the observed data.\nAnd now, to compare previous beliefs (prior) to updated knowledge (posterior) we can introduce the concept of Bayes Factor, which is a ratio between to candidate statistical models represented by marginal likelihood to measure the support for one model over the other. For example, if we have 0.167 as a prior belief of obtaining a #6, and our updated likelihood (after combining with observed data) results 0.334:\n\\[\nBayes Factor = \\frac{0.334}{0.167} = 2\n\\]\nThus, our updated hypothesis is twice as likely to be true than our prior hypothesis given the observed data.\nTherefore, when we analyze our data:\n\nFrequentism assumes models being fixed and our data random (maximum likelihood, conditional to theoretical events).\nBayesian assumes that models can vary around our data (conditional to observed data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor simple models, however, the two approaches would be practically indistinguishable‚Ä¶\nHINT: think about uninformative prior knowledge!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe structure of the Bayesian theory is similar to the Human Logic process:\n(i) we have some data,\n(ii) we have beliefs about the underlying process,\n(iii) combining both, we can update our beliefs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[ P(A_{true} | B)  = \\frac{P(B|A_{true}) * P(A_{true})}{P(B)}\\] \\[ Posterior  = \\frac{Likelihood * Prior}{Evidence}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriors are basically a formalization of our believes in a form of a mathematical function describing a ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù. First, it depends on the nature of the variable of interest, which could be ‚Äúdiscrete‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù. Second, it depends on what we know (or not) about the process of interest‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nThere is a very important difference between Frequentism and Bayesianism in terms of error interpretation. Let‚Äôs say we estimate 95% confidence and credible intervals for \\(\\theta\\):\n\nConfidence intervals (Frequentist): ‚ÄúIf we repeat the experiment infinite times, 95% of the estimated confidence intervals will contain the true value of \\(\\theta\\) (based on repeated measurements)‚Äú. Note that since \\(\\theta\\) is fixed, it can only be within or outside the interval.\nCredible intervals (Bayesian): In contrast, Bayesianism has a ‚Äúliteral‚Äù interpretation of the error saying, *‚Äúthere is a probability of 95% that the parameter* \\(\\theta\\) lies within this credible interval‚Äù. This is a range of probable values. Note:‚ÄùGiven that the prior is correct‚Äù‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian Models: A Statistical Primer for Ecologists.
