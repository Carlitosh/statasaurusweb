# Introduction to Bayesian Stats  

This article is intended to provide a brief introduction to key concepts about Bayesian theory and differences with the traditional Frequentist approach:  

::: callout-important
Neither of both, Frequentist or Bayesian, are always the most suitable solution for your analysis. However....ðŸ˜‰
:::

For this reason, today we are going to discuss and compare both approaches.  

Let's watch some short videos about it  

## 1. Frequentism vs Bayesianism

What do you think?

## 2. Main Differences  

Perhaps, the main disagreement between Frequentism and Bayesianism is about the TRUTH.  

The Frequentism vision is heavily rooted on the actual existence of the TRUTH. Every time we estimate a model's parameter, we expect to approximate to a true value. It is named "frequentism" because it is based on the frequency of repeated events.  

The Bayesian approach instead, DOES NOT assume the existence of the TRUTH. In contrast, it is based on PROBABILITIES & BELIEFS.  

PROBABILITIES: For the Bayesian vision, everything is a matter of probability. Any fact or result about an "estimate" could range from extremely unlikely to extremely likely. However, anything is considered completely true or false.

BELIEFS: here is probably the most important point of the Bayesian vision. Bayesian models allow to introduce (and update) prior knowledge on a topic, introducing our own certainty or uncertainty about events. EVEN IF WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING about it (spoiler alter: uninformative prior!).

Thus, when we analyze our data:

a.  Frequentism assumes models being fixed and our data random (maximum likelihood).

b.  Bayesian assumes that models can vary around our data (conditional)

::: callout-note
For simple models, however, the two approaches would be practically indistinguishable...

HINT: think about uninformative prior knowledge!
:::

Probably, the structure of the Bayesian theory is more similar to the Science process: (i) we have some data, (ii) we have believes about the underlying process, (iii) combining both, we update our believes.

## 3. Bayes Theorem

$$ P(A_{true} | B)  = \frac{P(B|A_{true}) * P(A_{true})}{P(B)}$$ $$ Posterior  = \frac{Likelihood * Prior}{Evidence}$$

## 4. The Priors

Priors are basically a formalization of our believes in a form of a mathematical function describing a "distribution". First, it depends on the nature of the variable of interest, which could be "discrete" or "continuous". Second, it depends on what we know (or not) about the process of interest...  

## 5. Other important concepts  

95% Credible intervals (Bayesian): "there is a probability of 95% that the parameter $\theta$ lies within this interval." This is a range of probable values.   
95% Confidence intervals (Frequentist): "95% of the confidence intervals contain the true value of $\theta$ (based on repeated measurements)". Note that since $\theta$ is fixed, it can only be within or outside the interval.
